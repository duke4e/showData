**Begin** by learning how to install the ShowLive and SL App Helper shortcuts onto your device. Then see what other features the SL App Installer Shortcut has to make things as simple as possible.

**Browse** the included themes, tap what you like and it’s a one tap action to download the theme of your choice. Simply run ShowLive to apply your chosen theme to your Homescreen, Lockscreen or both.

The first thing you should do is install the **ShowLive shortcut** and then the **SL App Helper shortcuts**.

ShowLive is the shortcut that renders and applies your chosen theme onto the Homescreen, Lockscreen or Both.
<br/>
<br/>
**Navigate to the ShowApp** and find the section that says “Shortcuts” Tap the “GET” button next to ShowLive v1.9b5. A new window will open and confirm you want to download the shortcut. Tap on the “Get Shortcut” button.

ShowLive will now download and install to your “My Shortcuts” section in the Shortcuts App. **Note:** Run the shortcut before downloading any themes from the app.

Just tap on the shortcut and when the prompts pop up always select “Always Allow”, if you don’t allow all the prompts the shortcut cannot run properly. If you tap don’t allow by mistake you can go into the settings and reset the current privacy rules and start again.

The shortcut will set everything up required and will take a few seconds to complete. A message will appear to let you know the shortcut has finished installing.
<br/>
<br/>
That’s it, ShowLive is now installed and ready to install themes! **Now install the SL App Helper.**
