Navigate to the ShowApp and find the section that says “Shortcuts” Tap the “GET” button next to ShowLive v1.9b5. A new window will open and confirm you want to download the shortcut. Tap on the “Get Shortcut” button.

ShowLive will now download and install to your “My Shortcuts” section in the Shortcuts App. **Note:** Run the shortcut before downloading any themes from the app.

Just tap on the shortcut and when the prompts pop up always select “Always Allow”, if you don’t allow all the prompts the shortcut cannot run properly. If you tap don’t allow by mistake you can go into the settings and reset the current privacy rules and start again.

The shortcut will set everything up required and will take a few seconds to complete. A message will appear to let you know the shortcut has finished installing.

That’s it, ShowLive is now installed and ready to install themes! Now install the SL App Helper.
