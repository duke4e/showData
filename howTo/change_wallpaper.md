## CHANGE A SHOWLIVE WALLPAPER 

Navigate to your Shortcuts app and tap to open **”ShowLive Helper”** shortcut. 

You will see a menu with various options. Select the option **“Install Wallpaper”**, then choose **“Homescreen”** or **“Lockscreen”**

> *Note: Only the wallpaper used with ShowLive themes will be changed. If you don’t have a Lockscreen theme installed and you select “Lockscreen” from the menu, the wallpaper won’t change on the Lockscreen when you run ShowLive.*

Select the Wallpaper you want to change on the menu. You will now be asked to pick a new wallpaper from your photo’s album. This can be any image. ShowLive will resize it to fit your device correctly. 

You may receive a prompt asking for permission, select **“Always Allow”**. The selected wallpaper will be copied and transferred into the ShowLive folder.

That’s it! The wallpaper is now transferred, named and ready to be applied by running ShowLive.
