### SHOWLIVE HELPER AND INSTALL A THEME

Navigate to the ShowApp and find the section that says **“Shortcuts”**. Tap the **“GET”** button next to ShowLive Helper. 

A new window will open and confirm you want to download the shortcut. Tap on the **“Get Shortcut”** button.

ShowLive Helper will now download and install to your “My Shortcuts” section in the Shortcuts App. 

> *Note: You do not need to run the shortcut before downloading any themes from the app.*

The ShowLive Helper shortcut primarily is actioned from the share sheet. When you tap to download a theme, the selected theme is downloaded and once download completes, the share sheet will pop up from the bottom of the screen. 

Select **”ShowLive Helper”** from the list on the share sheet. 

> *Note: I recommend editing the share sheet and moving ShowLive Helper into the favourites section at the very top of the list.*

You will be prompted for permission during the first run. You must choose **“Always Allow”** for the shortcut to function properly.

The downloaded theme will be installed in the ShowLive folder that was previously set up during the installation of the ShowLive shortcut at path: 

`iCloudDrive/Shortcuts/ShowLive/`

You will see a confirmation that the theme file has been installed with the option to either **“Run ShowLive”** or **“Exit”**

If you choose **“Run ShowLive”** the theme will be actioned by the ShowLive shortcut and applied to your device.

> *Note: if you tap anywhere during this process the installation will cancel.*

During the first run of ShowLive you will be prompted via a notification to Allow access to various weather information. You must always tap **“Always Allow”** for the shortcut to function properly.

> *Note: If there is no theme wallpaper installed you will promoted to choose one from your photo library.*

Choose an image you want to set as your wallpaper and ShowLive will copy that image to the ShowLive folder.

> *Note: The first run of ShowLive can take longer than usual. Be patient even if you think nothing is happening, ShowLive is still running*

Selecting **Exit** will quit the ShowLive Helper shortcut. Your downloaded theme is still installed into the ShowLive folder for application later. 

That’s all there is to it! You have successfully installed the ShowLive Helper.
