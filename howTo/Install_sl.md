### INSTALL SHOWLIVE SHORTCUT

Navigate to the ShowApp and find the section labelled “Shortcuts” Tap the **“GET”** button next to ShowLive. 

A new window will open and confirm you want to download the shortcut. Tap on the **“Get Shortcut”** button.

ShowLive will now download and install to your “All Shortcuts” section in the Shortcuts App. 

> *Note: Run the shortcut before downloading any themes from the app.*

Just tap on the shortcut to run it for the first time and when the prompts pop up always select **“Always Allow”**

> *Note: If you don’t allow all the prompts the shortcut cannot run properly. If you tap don’t allow by mistake you can go into the shortcut settings and reset the current privacy rules and start again.*

The shortcut will initiate the installation process which usually take’s a few seconds to complete. A message will appear to let you know the shortcut has finished installing.

That’s it, ShowLive is now installed and ready to install themes! 

> *Note: Some themes rely on different information depending on the design and you may still need to confirm prompts as ShowLive runs, it is very important that you ***“Always Allow”*** every time you see a prompt.*

Now it’s time to install the SL App Helper.
