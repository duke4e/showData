### UPDATE YOUR THEME WITH AUTOMATIONS 

Updating the information on your theme requires the ShowLive shortcut to be run again each time you want to update the information. This can be done in two ways:

- Manually run the ShowLive shortcut
- Shortcut Automations

Personal Automations allows the ShowLive shortcut to be run in the background without any intervention by the user.

> Creating personal automations requires some set up in the Shortcuts App.

There are various ways available to trigger personal automations, the most common practice is to use the **Time Of Day** function. 

EG, **Every hour from 6am to 8pm** or at **Sunset** and **Sunrise** or even a combination of both. You can also use **location triggers** to run ShowLive so that when you arrive or leave a certain location ShowLive shortcut will run and update your theme. 

> Apple has a page dedicated to creating personal automations: [Create a new personal automation in Shortcuts on iPhone or iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/shortcuts/apdfbdbd7123/ios)

**There are some mportant settings to remember when creating your automations.**

In order to create seamless automations there are two toggles to **turn off** called **"Ask Before Running"** and **"Notify When Run"**. Turning off both these toggles ensures that you dont recieve any notifications before and after the ShowLive shortcut has been actioned with your personal automation.

Thatâ€™s it you have successfully set up personal automations!
