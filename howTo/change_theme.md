### CHANGE A SHOWLIVE THEME

Make sure you have both the ShowLive and ShowLive Helper shortcuts installed first!

Navigate to the **“Themes”** section and browse  for a theme you’d like to install. Once you have found a theme tap **“GET”** to download it. 

> *Note: Some themes apply to the Home Screen and others to the Lock Screen. You can identify which screen that particular theme applies to by the **“Screen Tag”** directly below the theme image.*
> 
> *Identified by **Home** or **Lock***

Follow the process for installing the theme as described in the **“ShowLive Helper”** tutorial. 

The ShowLive Helper Shortcut will overwrite your currently installed theme and prompt you to **“Run ShowLive”** or **“Exit”**

That’s it you have successfully changed themes!
