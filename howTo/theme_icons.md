### THEME YOUR HOMESCREEN ICONS 

**ShowApp or ShowLive Shortcut cannot theme your Homescreen icons.** To do this there are two methods I would recommend:

- iOS ShortCuts Method
- Appstore App

> Creating themed icons with iOS SHortcut is my preffered choice

Using iOS Shortcuts to theme your Homescreen icons is my recommended method. This method requires you to theme each individual icon, creating a shortcut to each app whilst using a custom icon image of your choice.

The process for creating these app shortcuts is a straight forward process and simple once you have themed one or two icons. iDM from YouTube has an excellent video showing you how to thme your icons with the Shortcuts method (Link at the bottom of the page).

> Using Shortcuts to theme your icons does have downsides

Some important things to be aware of are:

- You will not recieve badge alerts on your app
- Sometimes you will see a brief banner notification when opening an app

> You can theme icons with an app from the iOS AppStore

There are a few apps available to theme your icons and usually work in a different way to the Shortcuts method. The app creates a profile which is applied via iOS Settings. Depending on which app you choose, the user experience can be varied and my reason why I prefer the Shortcuts method.


Thatâ€™s it you have successfully themed your icons!
