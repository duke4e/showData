### SHOWLIVE HELPER -ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONS 

The ShowLive Helper is a universal shortcut that can perform a number of tasks. Primarily used to manage ShowLive themes it can also manage theme files and wallpaper installation and deletion. 

Advanced features include removal of base64 encoded objects from the theme JSON as well as being able to encode base64 assets for inclusion in the theme file.

Navigate to your Shortcuts app and tap on **“ShowLive Helper”** where a menu will pop up.

> *Installing wallpaper is already covered in another tutorial so let’s focus on managing theme files.*

Theme files are downloaded from the ShowApp and include everything required to apply a theme using the ShowLive shortcut. The theme file is a common JSON format which, after being downloaded is stored the the ShowLive folder in Shortcuts.

> *Theme files are named to correspond with the screen that is being set with ShowLive.*

When presented with the Installer menu you have two options to manage theme files, **“Delete Homescreen Theme”** and **“Delete Lockscreen Theme”**

Tap on the action you want to perform and the corresponding theme file will firstly be renamed, backed up and the original theme file deleted. This is useful when you are creating your own themes. 

> **Note. Only the last theme file is ever backed up!**

That’s it, you have successfully deleted a theme file!

> **Advanced functions should only be used by users who have experience with editing JSON files.**

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. ShowLive uses this data to perform various actions within the shortcut.

This data is stored in theme files named **configHS.json** & **configLS.json**. Editing these JSON files with a text editor is how you alter and customise ShowLive theme files to move text, changed effects and apply alternate overlays etc.

ShowLive themes are different from other theming shortcuts as almost all assets are encoded to base64 and added to the JSON for use by the ShowLive shortcut. This is why you need the advanced functions in the ShowLive Helper shortcut.

> *The advanced functions have been added so that you can easily remove and add objects to the theme JSON file without using a text editor.*

It sounds easy however one mistake in the JSON can result in ShowLive not running as expected or even at all. I would strongly recommend visitng the Show support channel on Discord before attempting to edit a theme file.

On the Show Support channel you will find extensive instruction on how to edit and add objects to your theme. A link to visit the Show Discord channel can be found below.
