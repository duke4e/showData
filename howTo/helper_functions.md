## SHOWLIVE HELPER -ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONS 

The ShowLive Installer is a universal shortcut that can perform a number of tasks. Primarily used to manage ShowLive themes it can also manage them files and wallpaper installation and deletion.

Navigate to your Shortcuts app and tap on **“ShowLive Helper”** where a menu will pop up.

> Installing wallpaper is already covered in another tutorial so let’s focus on managing theme files.

Theme files are downloaded from the ShowApp and include everything required to apply a theme using the ShowLive shortcut. The theme file is a common JSON format which, after being downloaded is stored the the ShowLive folder in Shortcuts.

> Theme files are named to correspond with the screen that is being set with ShowLive.

When presented with the Installer menu you have two options to manage theme files, **“Delete Homescreen Theme”** and **“Delete Lockscreen Theme”**

Tap on the action you want to perform and the corresponding theme file will firstly be renamed, backed up and the original theme file deleted. This is useful when you are creating your own themes. 

> **Note. Only the last theme file is ever backed up!**

That’s it, you have successfully deleted a theme file!
