### WHATS THIS APP AND SHORTCUTS ALL ABOUT?

Apple doesn’t allow theming your iOS device natively. This app along with the ShowLive shortcuts help by allowing you to set “themes” on your Home and Lock screens. 

> *The app showcases themes from the best creators and allows you to browse and download a theme to your device.*

The themes contain **static information** like weather condition, battery level, moon phase information, weather forecast and more. 

> *Note: The theme information is overlaid on a wallpaper image and then set on your Home and/or Lock screen. The information contained in the theme won’t update until you run the ShowLive shortcut again.*

When you select a theme from the **Themes tab**, a zip file is downloaded that contains the theme file. This file contains all the information the ShowLive shortcut needs to build the theme. 

The ShowLive Helper shortcut is the “bridge” between the app and the ShowLive shortcut and allows you to run the ShowLive shortcut , change Home and Lock Screen wallpapers, change theme items and more. 

> *The Helper was designed to make changing themes etc as simple as possible for the end user.*

**Before you download a theme you will need to install the ShowLive and ShowLive Helper shortcuts.**

Now you have a basic understanding on how a theme is installed it’s time to do download the shortcuts, find a theme you like and install it with the ShowLive Helper shortcut!
