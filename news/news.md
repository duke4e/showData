#### ShowLive v1.929
June 21st 2022

ShowLive Shortcut updated:

+ Only one shortcut now required for iOS 14, 15 & 16

Shortcut versions for iOS 14 & 15 work as normal and set wallpaper automatically. iOS 16 Version continues to use the workaround but will show a preview of the theme and will also save the image to your "Recents" photo album for setting manually in Wallpaper settings.

The link has been updated in the "Shortcuts" section in the App.

Please remember to "Always Allow" on every prompt.
