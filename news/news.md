#### ShowLive v1.926 iOS16 
May 07th 2022


Added support for iOS 16

This is a workaround version as "Set Wallpaper" action is broken in this version of iOS.

A pop-up with instructions on how to apply the ShowLive theme to your screen is shown after ShowLive completes compiling the theme.

Use the Helper shortcut as normal to install the theme.
